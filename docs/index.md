In this blog post we will address and evaluate a novel approach to few-shot learning. This approach has been presented in the article Attentional Constellation Nets For Few-shot Learning by Weijian Xu, Yifan Xu, Huaijin Wang, and Zhuowen Tu, published in 2021. Throughout this post we will first introduce few-shot learning. Then we will present the contribution to the field the previously stated paper provided. Finally we will evaluate the models presented in the paper and apply them to a different problem than few-shot learning, namely domain generalization.
